# SDRaD Examples and Test Cases
This folder contains examples of how to use the SDRaD library

## Prerequisites

Before compiling and running the examples, make sure you have built the SDRaD library (`libsdrad.so`) and added the SDRaD source directory containing the shared object to the Linux dynamic linker search path.

To compile SDRaD, Run `make` in [src/](../src/):

```
cd ../src
make
```

To add the SDRaD source directory containing the resulting shared object to the dynamic linker search path set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environmental variable to include the [src/](../src/) directory:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='/path/to/secure-rewind-and-discard/src'
```

## Building and running the SDRaD examples

To build examples, run `make` in the [examples/](./examples/) directory:

```
cd ../examples
make
```

If `libsdrob.so` can be found in the dynamic linker search path, the resulting example executables can be run as indicated below:

* An example of how to use  `sdrad_call`. If the user enters more than 6 bytes, the stackoverflow can be detected. 
```
./sdrad_call_example
Enter Keyword 
hello
Current Buf : hello
Enter Keyword 
merhaba
ERROR_BAD_INPUT 
Enter Keyword:
```
* SDRaD allows rewinding applications in the case of stackoverflow in the isolated domain. The application should be compiled with `__wrap_stack_chk_fail`  `-fstack-protector` compiler options.  If the user enters more than 4 bytes, the stackoverflow can be detected. 
```
./stackoverflow_handler
WAITING REQUEST

HANDLING REQUEST 
Success: Domain Violation Detected

```
* SDRaD allows rewinding applications in case of a segmentation fault in the nested domain. 
```
./segfault_handler
Success: Domain Violation Detected
```

* The nested domain cannot modify global variables.
```
./global_data_test
Success: Domain Violation Detected
```

* The nested domain cannot modify the stack area of the parent domain.
```
./stack_violation
Success: Domain Violation Detected
```

* SDRaD protects the thread memory area from its own nested domain. 

Note that requires multithreading support for sdrad library. To compile the sdrad library with multithreading support, use the following command: `SDRAD_CONFIG=-DSDRAD_MULTITHREAD make`
```
./pthread_example
Success: Domain Violation Detected
```
